## The project
This is a demo of a static verison of Link's Awakenings overworld running on the playdate.

Walk with the D-Pad and sprint using the B-Button.

There are currently no collisions, so you can just walk around the world and enjoy it without boundaries.

This demo works with a variable framerate and solid 49 fps on device. By replacing the images under source/images/assets you could also get Pok√©mon Red/Blue/Yellows map or any other games map running.
